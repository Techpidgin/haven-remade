              Blueprint Haven works across housing, culture and hospitality. Each project
              begins with a week of looking: sun paths, sightlines, the noise of the street
              at seven in the morning. What follows is a set of drawings precise enough that
              the contractor never has to guess.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
              We keep the team deliberately mixed — architects beside interior designers,
              researchers beside model makers — so that structure, light and material are
              decided in the same room.
